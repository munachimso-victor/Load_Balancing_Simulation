# Load_Balancing_Simulation
### This Simulation software Demonstrates how a load balancer connected to web servers reacts to multiple connection requests from various computers
### This Simulation exhibits efficient scaling and load distribution that is implemented in enterprise and cloud networks
#### Resources: Python, Regex, Object Oriented Programming

#### WHAT IS LOAD BALANCING? ####
Based on wikipedia,"Load balancing refers to the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient."

The aim of the simulation is to illustrate how a load balancer performs its job.

This Simulation has two modes
=> The Automated Scenario Simulation mode
=> The Regular Simulation mode

## The Automated Scenario Simulation mode ##
 In this mode we would be able to see the load balancer in action.
 
 The scenario enables us to understand how the simulation works, and the possible functionalities it can perform in a production environment
 
 The Scenarios shows the behaviour of the load balancer on the different occasions of a regular workday and how it adapts to connections and disconnections. In cloud computing this behaviour is known as ELASTICITY.
 
 The occasions are:
 =>Beginning of workday
 =>Lunch Break/ Middle of workday
 =>End of workday


## The Regular Simulation mode ##
In this mode the user that runs the simulations has control of of the load balancer. The user has options at his disposal to perform different operations on the simulation.
This mode is really useful when it comes to testing the various capabilities of the Simulation

These options Include:
=>Add a connection: Manually or Auotmatically, Single or Multiple Connections
=>Remove a connection: Specific or Random or All 
=>View a report on computers connected to servers
=>View a report on the  Total Load on all the servers
